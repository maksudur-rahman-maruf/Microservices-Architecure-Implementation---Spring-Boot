Distributed Tracing Application 
- Zipkin / Sleuth [lets you track the progress of subsequent microservices by adding trace and span id on the HTTP Request Header]

Application Monitoring Solution
- Prometheus / Micrometer [actuator is used inside, we used actuator too for monitoring application]
- Graphana
[Monitoring solution for datasource/database, It has nicer dashboard UI than Prometheus
It provides charts, graphs or alerts for the web when connected to suppurted datasources, 
Here Prometheus is the datasources for graphana]
